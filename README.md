# Movie-Rating-Prediction-using-ML

<h2>Objective</h2>
The main goal of the project was to predict movie ratings based on various features such as genre, director, cast, and other relevant attributes. <br>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Genre</li>
  <li>Year</li>
  <li>Duration</li>
  <li>Rating</li>
  <li>Votes</li>
  <li>Director</li>
  <li>Actor1</li>
  <li>Actor2</li>
  <li>Actor1</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
To prepare the data for the Random Forest Regression model, you performed several preprocessing steps:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Handling Missing Values: Missing values were addressed using techniques such as imputation.</li>
  <li>Feature Engineering: New features were created from existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.</li>
  <li>Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical features like genre and director were encoded using methods such as one-hot encoding.</li>
  <li>Normalization: Continuous features were normalized to ensure the model performed well.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The project showcased the effectiveness of the Random Forest Regression algorithm in predicting movie ratings. It highlighted the significance of feature selection and preprocessing in building accurate predictive models. <br>
